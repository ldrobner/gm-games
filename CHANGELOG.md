This is a user-focused changelog. The entries here are things that affect gameplay, not technical details behind the scenes.

* 2020-10-03: New option in God Mode to change the number of draft rounds. This does not change the talent pool - if you add more draft rounds, the additional draft prospects will not be very good. If you remove draft rounds, there will be more good undrafted free agents. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/j4peh5/new_option_in_god_mode_to_change_the_number_of/)

* 2020-10-01: In honor of our glorious upcoming election, I am introducing the most American option ever added to Basketball GM: a new draft type "No lottery, best to worst" in which the best teams get the best picks in the draft. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/j3k1g9/in_honor_of_our_glorious_upcoming_election_i_am/)

* 2020-09-19: In BBGM, new God Mode option to set the number of players on the court. By default it's 5-on-5, but now it can be anything. Extreme values may do weird things. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/ivlhui/new_god_mode_option_to_set_the_number_of_players/)

* **2020-09-17: New player mood system! Most notable improvements are that it's viewable at any time (not just during free agency) and it's much more transparent about what players think about your team. If your star is not happy and doesn't want to re-sign, you'll know ahead of time. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/09/player-mood/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/iuluuj/the_new_player_mood_system_is_now_live_in_version/)**

* 2020-09-07: New challenge mode "Lose best player every season", where at the end of the playoffs every season, the best player on your team will either retire (if he's a real player) or die a tragic death (if he's a random player). Thanks @luso97! [[1]](https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games/pull/311/files) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/iod22d/new_challenge_mode_lose_best_player_every_season/)

* 2020-08-26: Tweaks to game simulation in the playoffs, most notably resulting in fewer upsets. Also injuries in the playoffs are shorter, to work around the fact that currently there is no way to have players play through minor injuries. [[1]](https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games/pull/293)

* 2020-08-18: If you are successful (high score in the owner's annual performance review) then sometimes other teams will try to hire you. This happens between the playoffs and draft.

* 2020-08-18: Purely cosmetic player attributes that don't affect gameplay or achievements (name, height (inches), weight (lbs), jersey number, college) are editable outside of God Mode by going to a player's page and clicking Edit Player. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/iccp0h/purely_cosmetic_player_attributes_that_dont/)

[[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/08/smarter-contract-generation/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i5qoj3/new_beta_feature_smarter_contracts_no_more_good/) [[3]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i77k9w/smarter_contract_generation_is_live_in_version/)

* 2020-08-10: In BBGM, box scores show players who didn't play as DNP (either "Injury" or "Coach's decision") rather than showing a row of all 0s.

* 2020-08-08: In BBGM, in the live game play-by-play, fouls show how many free throws will be upcoming. Like "Shooting foul on Dane Wishnowsky, two FTs for Stephen Lees". Additionally, shot attempts appear on their own line before saying if they are made or missed. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i6792d/in_the_live_game_playbyplay_fouls_show_how_many/)

* 2020-08-02: Added a "Delete Player" button to player profile pages.

This is especially important for FBGM where rosters are huge and much scrolling is required. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hz68ru/this_is_more_important_for_fbgm_than_bbgm_but_on/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hz69o2/on_the_trade_page_the_trade_summary_and_controls/)

* 2020-07-10: For FBGM, improved AV formula for OL and defensive players, resulting in higher AV for top players at those positions. I also updated the MVP and DPOY formulas to account for this, hopefully retaining good position balance.

* 2020-07-09: A bunch of small FBGM improvements. [[1]](https://football-gm.com/blog/2020/07/recent-development-av-kickers-punters-future/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hogban/recent_development_some_small_improvements/)

* 2020-06-27: Random debuts mode now works how you probably wanted it to work in the first place. The pool of players to be randomized is not just current and future players (relative to your starting season), but past players too. So if you start in 2020, you'll get many future draft classes of randomized real players. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hh71an/random_debuts_mode_now_works_how_you_probably/)

* 2020-06-27: Menu on the Standings page to switch between League/Conference/Division standings, which is important on mobile where previously only the division standings were visible. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hgxh7p/menu_on_the_standings_page_to_switch_between/)

* 2020-06-26: Support for exporting/importing individual players or groups of players, at Tools > Import/Export Players. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hgakyd/import_and_export_individual_players_from_leagues/)

* 2020-06-08: Sortable table rows (roster, fantasy draft, football depth chart) can be reordered by clicking two rows to swap them, in addition to dragging like normal. This is sometimes easier on mobile.

* **2020-06-07: Added the News Feed page, available in the League menu. This incorporates a score for each event that happens, allowing you to filter events by importance. This replaces the old Transactions and Event Log pages. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/news-feed/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gyc615/news_feed_changes_are_live_in_version_202006070785/)**

* 2020-06-03: If you use God Mode to retire a player, it checks for Hall of Fame eligibility and notifies you if he makes it. And when you edit a player's contract, it also updates the "Salaries" table on player pages and the "Career Earnings" frivolity. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/real-rosters-back-to-1947-contraction/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gvtw5o/new_features_in_version_202006030801_real_rosters/)
