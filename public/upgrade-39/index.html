    <title>Basketball GM Upgrade Fallback</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Use this if you're having trouble upgrading from version 38 to 39 (the player mood update) like <a href="https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games/issues/318">described here</a>.</p>

    <p>It's okay if this gets interrupted in the middle, just start it again. And running it on an already-upgraded league will not break anything.</p>

    <form id="form">
      <select id="league"></select>
      <button type="submit">Upgrade</button>
    </form>
    <br>

    <div id="status"></div>
